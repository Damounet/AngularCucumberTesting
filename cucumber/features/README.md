# Gherkin

    > Feature: Initial state
    >   Scenario: The user goes on the heroes page from the initial page
    >       Given the user is on Tour of Heroes
    >       When the user click on heroes button
    >       Then the user is on the heroes page

    The code above is write with Gherkin. This is basically a language which is use to write functionnal testing. As you can see it is really close to english speaking.

    Gherkin is working with keywords which are starting all the Gherkin phrases.
    Let's see these more precisely.

## Feature

    > Feature: Initial state

    Feature is exactly what it says, it is the Feature functionnal description.
    Don't hesitate to be as precise as possible. The more precise it is, the more understandable it is.
    This is in the Feature space that you have to describe the user story environment.

## Scenario

    >   Scenario: The user goes on the heroes page from the initial page

    As the Feature keyword, Scenario is describing the scenario as precisely as possible.
    For one Feature, it is possible and common to have more than one Scenario.

## Steps

    >       Given the user is on Tour of Heroes
    >       When the user click on heroes button
    >       Then the user is on the heroes page

    All the phrases which are in a scenario and starting with the keywords Given, When or Then are called Steps.

### Given

    >       Given the user is on Tour of Heroes

    The keyword Given is always describing a scenario context.

### When

    >       When the user click on heroes button

    The keyword When is always describing an user action.

### Then

    >       Then the user is on the heroes page

    The keyword Then is checking a result from an user action.

## Background

    > Feature: Dashboard
    >   Background: The user is on Tour of Heroes and the page is displaying the dashboard
    >       Given the user is on Tour of Heroes
    >       And the page displays the dashboard

    The Background keyword is doing its steps before all the scenarios which are in the same feature.
    The And keyword is used to says that it is the same keyword than the above one.

## Scenario outline

    > Scenario Outline: The user click on Narco in the top heroes grid
    >   When the user clicks on <heroName> button from top heroes grid
    >   Then the user is on the <heroName> hero details page

    A Scenario Outline is a Scenario which is doing its steps more than one time. It always come with an Examples Table to give some values to the placeholder.
    A placeholder is basically a variable.

### Examples

    > Examples: Hero name
    >   | heroName  |
    >   | 'Narco'   |
    >   | 'Magneta' |

    An examples table is used to give some values to the Scenario outline placeholders. This one has some values for the heroName placeholder, these values are 'Narco' and 'Magneta'. Then, the concerned Scenario outline will be played two times with the two differents values.

# Our best practices

    One Feature = One Feature file.
    Understandable english.
    Steps order :
        A Given step can be followed by a When or another Given (write it And) or nothing.
        A When step can be followed by a Then or another When (write it And).
        A Then step can be followed by another Then (write it And) or nothing or a When if it is really necessary and if there is no other possibility to separate the Scenario in two scenarios.
    You can write steps with the third person, this is always good, and with the first person. If you are using the first person, it is referencing to the user describe in the user story environment which is in the Feature keyword. If there is no user describe in the user story environment, then always use the third person.
